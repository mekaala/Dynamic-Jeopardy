**MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT**

First design your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing an MVP before getting too involved with advanced features. Start writing your README file with some basic ideas. Timebox any experimental or optional ideas, features, or technologies. Remember that good time management is key!

**What game should I make?**

I want to develop and design a game that I can enjoy developing in order to be 100% successful. One that allows me the freedom of expressing myself would be ideal. In terms of customization, I will develop a **Jeopardy** game.

**How to play Jeopardy**

Players have to answer questions from different themes. There are five themes, each containing five questions that range from easy to difficult. Easy prompts have low points, and difficult prompts have high points.

**What should I develop first?**

Five categories.
Five buttons/questions for each category.
A "Final Question".

**HTML**

Elements:
Button: each card is a button that opens the question. The player should type in the answer in order to receive points.


**JAVASCRIPT**

For each button, there is a different prompt. We must make conditionals that evaluate if the player has input the correct answer for the chosen question.
The questions are multiple choice:
If their answer is correct: the player receives points based on the value of the question.
Else: the player is returned to the home screen, and no points have been added.
Numerical Values must be added together to create a score for the player.


**EXTRA: What else can be added to the game (IF I have more time)?**

Multiple players: Track the scores of multiple players.
A score board IF there are multiple players.
A "grade". Compare the total points earned with the total points they could have earned SO FAR.
